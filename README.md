# UniESA
A unified farmework for effectively and accurately engineering enzyme stereoselectivity and  activity.  

## Introduction of UniESA
High stereoselectivity, as well as activity, is essential for enzymeâ€™s application in green industrial context. UniESA provides a unified framework for effectively and accurately engineering enzyme stereoselectivity and activity, and therefore can potentially significantly expedite the search for high-fitness enzyme mutants with minimal laboratory work. UniESA offers a rational, data-driven framework for large-scale enzyme characteristic optimization, and is suitable for green enzyme engineering in industrial context.

## Usage
gen_model.exe is used to generate the best model for a sepecific task, and UniESA_predict.exe is used to predict the property for specific mutants. 
Since the files are larger than the github allowed size, we are solving this problem now.
