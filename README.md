# UniESA
A unified farmework for effectively and accurately engineering enzyme stereoselectivity and activity


# Introduction of UniESA
High stereoselectivity, as well as activity, is essential for enzymeâ€™s application in green industrial context. UniESA provides a unified framework for effectively and accurately engineering enzyme stereoselectivity and activity, and therefore can potentially significantly expedite the search for high-fitness enzyme mutants with minimal laboratory work. UniESA offers a rational, data-driven framework for large-scale enzyme characteristic optimization, and is suitable for green enzyme engineering in industrial context.


# Usage
AAindex.exe is used to predict the property for specific mutants. Input your wild type sequence in the wt.exe, and substitute the input_data.csv by your own sequence and enzyme property. Now UniESA is ready to use.
